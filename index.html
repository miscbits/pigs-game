            <h3> The Rules </h3>
            <p>Pigs is an easy game to play. Two players take turns rolling a die</p>
            <p>If a player rolls anything but a one, that score is put into a bank</p>
            <p>That player can risk the score and roll the die again to get more points</p>
            <p>turns end when a player decides to add the points to their bank or if they roll a 1</p>
            <p>If a player rolls a 1, they lose all of their at risk points</p>
            <p>Each player can roll up to three times per turn</p>
            <p>Once a player hits 50 points, the game ends and that player wins!</p>
